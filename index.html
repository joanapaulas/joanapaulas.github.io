<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When we have a large list of genes of interest (for example, a list of differentially expressed genes obtained from an RNA-Seq experiment), how do we make sense of the biological meaning of that list? One way is to perform functional enrichment analysis. This method consists of the application of statistical tests to verify if genes of interest are more often associated to certain biological functions when compared with a random set of genes. In this tutorial you will learn about enrichment analysis and how to perform it.</p>
